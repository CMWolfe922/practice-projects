Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\\n\\n\"Two years ago, you used that power to make Donald Trump not only a former president, but you made him a defeated president,\" Biden told a crowd of cheering Philadelphia supporters who gathered at the Temple University basketball arena. \"And this year, you have the power to make John Fetterman your next Senator.\"\\n\\n© Andrew Harnik, AP President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, followed by first lady Jill Biden and former first lady Michelle Obama, arrive in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022, for the unveiling of the official White House portraits.\\n\\nMeet me in Penn:Trump, Obama and Biden hit the Pennsylvania campaign trail Saturday ahead of midterm elections\\n\\nTrump in 2024:Donald Trump teases Iowa crowd: \\'I will very, very, very probably\\' run for president\\n\\nA few hours later, and more than 250 miles away, Trump criticized Biden, attacked Fetterman, and talked up Pennsylvania\\'s Republican Senate candidate, doctor and television host Mehmet Oz – all the while dropping more hints that he will soon announce another campaign for the presidency in 2024.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to say it right now,\" Trump said during a tarmac rally at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, but he told a screaming crowd that \"you\\'re going to be so happy\" very soon. \"You\\'re going to be surprised at how soon.\"\\n\\nTrump told the crowd they need to elect Oz as part of a \"giant red wave\" on Election Day.\\n\\nThe Oz-Fetterman race could decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the U.S. Senate; Pennsylvania will also go a long way toward determining the presidential winner in 2024, just as it fueled the victories of Obama, Trump, and Biden.\\n\\nPennsylvania also features one of the premier gubernatorial races in the country, with Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano against Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Mastriano is a Trump loyalist who led calls for a 2020 audit and helped bus people to the Jan. 6, 2021 rally that turned into a riot at the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\n\"The abundance of competitive races in Pennsylvania make it coveted ground in this cycle,\" said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \"And the party\\'s biggest names are here to do what they can to get some candidates across the line.\"\\n\\nBiden: \"I\\'ve lived in Pennsylvania longer than Oz\"\\n\\nIn Philadelphia – home to the Phillies, fighting against a World Series loss – Biden and Obama argued that voting for Fetterman in the U.S. Senate and for other Democrats represents the crucial difference between women having the right to choose, maintaining voter integrity and generally keeping a path open to advancing a Democratic agenda.\\n\\nThe Democratic presidents stuck to broad themes, casting the Republicans as threats to democracy in general and the Biden agenda in particular, including programs to lower health costs, aid struggling families, and re-invest in infrastructure.\\n\\nAll the presidents and their favored candidates catered to Pennsylvania pride.\\n\\nFetterman, seemingly sticking his tongue in his cheek, said his Republican opponent Oz \"likes to pander.”\\n\\nThen, wading into a commonwealth war of convenience chain preferences, said: “I just really want to get this off my chest right now: Wawa is so much better than Sheetz. My whole life, I was all about that.”\\n\\nBiden, who was raised in Scranton and turns 80 this month, needled Oz as a sort of carpetbagger as Fetterman has throughout the campaign. A longtime U.S. Senator from Delaware, Biden flexed his Pennsylvania credentials by raising his old moniker as “Pennsylvania’s third Senator” to make the point that he knows the commonwealth intimately.\\n\\n“Look, I lived in Pennsylvania longer than Oz has lived in Pennsylvania – and I moved away when I was 10 years old,” Biden said.\\n\\nAs Obama did in an earlier speech in Pittsburgh, Biden said Fetterman is well on his way to recovery from a stroke: \"There\\'s no quit in John Fetterman...There\\'s no quit in America.\"\\n\\n© Getty Images This combination of file photos shows Democratic Senate candidate, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, left, and Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.\\n\\nTrump: \\'Who the hell voted for these people?\\'\\n\\nWhile bashing Biden and Fetterman, Trump also attacked Biden and the Democratic Congress over high gas prices, illegal border crossings, crime, law enforcement, and foreign relations.\\n\\nHitting the local angle, Trump said Biden climate change are gutting Pennsylvania\\'s busy energy industry, particularly coal mining.\\n\\n\"Who the hell voted for these people?\" Trump said.\\n\\nTrump also attacked the Biden administration over the many investigations into his conduct, including his handling of classified material, attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, and culpability for the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a disgrace what\\'s happening to our country,\" Trump said.\\n\\nAt one point, Trump also had harsh words for Obama, saying he negotiated a poor deal for a new Air Force One.\\n\\nIn teasing a 2024 campaign, Trump used two Jumbotrons to show slides of poll results showing him leading Biden in early match-ups.\\n\\nTrump also mocked potential Republican opponents during the slide show. Polls show him way ahead of potential GOP challenges, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – whom Trump nicknamed \"Ron De-sanctimonious.\"\\n\\nThe rally ended with Trump speaking over funereal music that some have likened to a QAnon theme.\\n\\nFetterman\\'s stroke:Fetterman defends Pennsylvania debate showing: \\'It was important that I show up, and I did it\\'\\n\\nOz vs, Fetterman:John Fetterman, Mehmet Oz spar in Pennsylvania US Senate debate on abortion, crime, fracking: recap\\n\\nObama and the games of politics\\n\\nObama began the day\\'s rally-o-rama in the mid-afternoon, speaking solo to thousands of supporters gathered at the University of Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park Saturday.\\n\\nMore: Obama in PA stumping for Fetterman: \\'Our democracy is on the ballot\\'\\n\\nLike so many campaign visitors, Obama buttered up the locals by giving shout-outs to local sports teams.\\n\\nObama expressed sympathy for the struggling Pittsburgh Steelers football team and their 2-6 record, noting that his Chicago Bears are a mere 3-5.\\n\\n\"We’re both doing a little rebuilding right now,\" Obama said. \"It’s okay, you know, these things kind of go in waves.\"\\n\\nHe laid it on thick in Philadelphia, calling the city the center of the sports world, given the Phillies\\' appearance in baseball\\'s World Series against the Houston Astros, and the fact that the Eagles football team currently 8-0, the last remaining undefeated team in pro football. He also gently mocked the pro basketball team, the Philadelphia 76ers.\\n\\n“Phillies have a chance to tie the World Series tonight,\" Obama said. \"Eagles look like they might be the best football team in the country. The Sixers – well, it’s early. It’s still early, so we won’t talk about them right now.”\\n\\nTrump also played the sports game by praising Latrobe\\'s favorite son and airport name, golfing legend Arnold Palmer. The former GOP president praised the late Palmer as a great man \"who\\'s looking down\" from heaven on his beloved city.\\n\\nOz vs. Fetterman\\n\\nMembers of the \"Presidents Club\" have good reason for focusing on Pennsylvania, particularly control of the Senate. The chamber is currently split 50-50, with Democrats in control because of the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\nIn terms of the current Senate campaign, Obama cited Fetterman\\'s aggressive style and unique mode of dress. \"You also know the guy’s tough,\" Obama said, \"and not just because he wears shorts in the middle of winter.”\\n\\nTrue to form, Fetterman wore a black hoodie and jeans to the event; Obama wore his typical post-presidential uniform: button-down shirt and dress pants.\\n\\nIn brief remarks at the Trump rally, Oz said Biden has taken the country backward. He urged supporters to bring 10 supporters to the polls, but only those who believe the country is worse off than it was two years ago.\\n\\n\"Tell them I believe we are the land of opportunity. Tell them we are the land of plenty. Tell them I will bring change to Washington,\" Oz said.\\n\\nShapiro vs. Mastriano\\n\\nThe presidents also weighed in on the Pennsylvania governor\\'s race between Mastriano and Shapiro.\\n\\nShapiro, appearing in Philadelphia, focused most on policy relevant to the commonwealth. He said he’d fully fund schools, end the reliance on standardized testing, raise the state minimum wage to $15 an hour and sign an executive order eliminating the requirement of a college degree for state government jobs.\\n\\nDuring the Trump rally, Mastrianio – wearing a Phillies baseball cap earlier in the day – attacked Shapiro\\'s record as attorney general, saying crime is up. He also criticized Biden over energy policy.\\n\\nA noted \"election denier,\" Mastriano also pledged to change Pennsylvania election laws if he wins, though he is trailing Shapiro in polls.\\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be a new day in P.A. on Tuesday,\" he told the Trump crowd.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: The political universe of Pennsylvania: Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Barack Obama pay visits', 'summary': '', 'authors': [], 'keywords': []}, {'_id': 5, 'title': 'Senior White House Official, Putin Aides Involved in Talks on Avoiding Wider War', 'body': '© Vitaly Nevar/Zuma Press\\n\\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s top national-security adviser has engaged in recent months in confidential conversations with top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to reduce the risk of a broader conflict over Ukraine and warn Moscow against using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, U.S. and allied officials said.\\n\\nThe officials said that U.S. national-security adviser Jake Sullivan has been in contact with Yuri Ushakov, a foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Putin. Mr. Sullivan also has spoken with his direct counterpart in the Russian government, Nikolai Patrushev, the officials added.The aim has been to guard against the risk of escalation and keep communications channels open, and not to discuss a settlement of the war in Ukraine, the officials said.\\n\\nAsked whether Mr. Sullivan has engaged in undisclosed conversations with Messrs. Ushakov or Patrushev, National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said: “People claim a lot of things” and declined to comment further. The Kremlin didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe White House hasn’t publicly acknowledged any calls between Mr. Sullivan and any senior Russian official since March, when he spoke with Mr. Patrushev.\\n\\nThe unpublicized discussions come as traditional diplomatic contacts between Washington and Moscow have dwindled and Mr. Putin and his aides have hinted he might resort to using nuclear arms to protect Russian territory, as well as gains made in his invasion of Ukraine this year.\\n\\nDespite its support for Ukraine and punitive measures against Russia for the invasion, the White House has said that maintaining some level of contact with Moscow is imperative for achieving certain mutual national-security interests.\\n\\nSeveral U.S. officials said that Mr. Sullivan is known within the administration as pushing for a line of communication with Russia, even as other top policy makers feel that talks in the current diplomatic and military environment wouldn’t be fruitful.\\n\\nOfficials didn’t provide the precise dates and number of the calls or say whether they had been productive.\\n\\nSome former American officials said that it was useful for the White House to maintain contact with the Kremlin as U.S.-Russian relations are at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War.\\n\\n“I think it’s always important, especially for nuclear-armed countries, to maintain open channels of communication to help understand what each side is thinking and thereby avoid the possibility of an accidental confrontation or war,” said Ivo Daalder, who served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. “National-security advisers are the closest conduit to the Oval Office without bringing the president directly into that communication channel.”\\n\\nPresident Biden sought to forge a working relationship with Mr. Putin during his first year in office, which culminated in a summit in Geneva in June 2021. Those talks touched on Ukraine, where the sides had clear differences, among an array of other subjects.\\n\\nBy October, however, U.S. intelligence indicated that Russian forces were preparing to invade Ukraine. CIA Director William Burns was sent to Moscow in early November 2021 to warn Mr. Putin against an invasion.\\n\\nMr. Biden spoke twice with Mr. Putin in December 2021 and again in February 2022 to try to avert a Russian attack while U.S. diplomats engaged with their Russian counterparts.\\n\\nAfter Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, however, diplomatic and military contacts between the two sides became infrequent.\\n\\nOfficials said Mr. Sullivan has taken a leading role in coordinating the Biden administration’s policy and plans in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—something that is expected of the president’s top national-security adviser. However, he has also been involved in diplomatic efforts, including a visit to Kyiv on Friday to speak with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, meetings traditionally handled by the secretaries of state or defense.\\n\\nMr. Sullivan has spoken to Ukraine’s leadership, urging them to publicly signal their willingness to resolve the conflict, a U.S. official said. The U.S. isn’t pushing Ukraine to negotiate, the official added, but rather to show allies that it is seeking a resolution to the conflict, which has affected world oil and food prices.\\n\\nThe Washington Post earlier reported efforts by Mr. Sullivan to persuade Ukrainian officials to seek a resolution.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Putin and his senior aides hinted in September that Russia might use nuclear weapons if his forces were pushed into a corner, Mr. Sullivan said that the Biden administration had “communicated directly, privately at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia.”\\n\\nThe White House had declined to say how that warning was communicated.\\n\\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and several of his allied counterparts spoke this past month with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu as Moscow claimed Kyiv was preparing to use a so-called dirty bomb against it, something Ukrainian and Western officials have denied.\\n\\nMr. Austin initiated the initial call, which was their first discussion since May, to stress the importance of maintaining lines of communication, the Pentagon said. Mr. Shoigu initiated the second.\\n\\nMr. Ushakov, the foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Putin, has served as an ambassador in Washington and is regarded by former and current U.S. officials as a conduit to the Russian leader.\\n\\nMr. Burns met with Mr. Ushakov in November 2021 during his visit to Moscow before speaking with Mr. Putin. Mr. Sullivan spoke again with Mr. Ushakov in December.\\n\\nIn his March conversation with Mr. Patrushev, which the White House described, Mr. Sullivan told the Russian official that Moscow’s forces should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns and warned the Kremlin not to use chemical or biological weapons.\\n\\nMr. Patrushev, who entered the KGB in the 1970s and rose to become director of the Federal Security Service from 1999 to 2008, is regarded by American officials as a hard-liner who shares many of Mr. Putin’s suspicions about the U.S.\\n\\nA Russian statement about the March conversation between Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Patrushev said that it took place at the initiative of the U.S., and that Mr. Patrushev has stressed “the need to stop Washington’s support of neo-Nazis and terrorists in Ukraine and facilitate the transfer of foreign mercenaries to the conflict zone, as well as refuse to continue supplying weapons to the Kiev regime.”\\n\\nEven as relations between Washington and Moscow have deteriorated, the U.S. has sought to preserve some areas of cooperation, especially on strategic arms control and the International Space Station.\\n\\nWashington and Moscow have adhered to the New START treaty, which limits long-range U.S. and Russian nuclear arms and is due to expire in 2026.\\n\\nU.S. and Russian officials are planning to hold meetings of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, which was established by the New START treaty to discuss its implementation, according to U.S. officials and a Russian media report. One aim is to discuss resuming inspections under New START that were suspended when the Covid-19 pandemic began, U.S. officials say.\\n\\nWhile Switzerland had been the traditional host nation for such talks, Moscow has said that it no longer considers it a neutral country because, like other European nations, it has imposed economic sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions have also complicated the Russians’ travel arrangements, so plans are being made to hold the meeting in Cairo in late November, the officials said.\\n\\nThe State Department and the Russian government declined to comment on the meetings, which aren’t generally announced in advance.\\n\\n—Nancy A.

The effort failed after the state Supreme Court in April picked a map similar to the 2011 version, which had helped Republicans gain majorities in the state Senate and the state Assembly.\\n\\nMr. Evers has made the map a key plank of his re-election campaign. The issue got a surge of media attention after social-media posts of audio from a recent Michels campaign event in which the candidate said, “Republicans will never lose another election in Wisconsin after I’m elected governor.”\\n\\nMr. Evers on Friday released a campaign ad that began with a narrator saying: “Did you know Tim Michels pledged to rig future elections?”\\n\\nMr. Michels has repeatedly declined to comment on the remarks and the issue of redistricting. In the past, he pledged to get rid of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, which administers and enforces voting rules in the state.\\n\\nHe proposed a “2.0” version of the commission during an August debate, saying that if people had problems with the makeup of such a body, they could go to their congressman. “There’s much more direct representation there,” Mr. Michels said, according to local media reports on the debate.\\n\\nThe battle for Wisconsin’s chief executive, like several others throughout the country, is extremely close, polling shows, and speaks to the even divide in this battleground state between Republicans and Democrats. The candidates here routinely hit the main national issues on the stump: crime, inflation and abortion.\\n\\nBut the redistricting issue is uniquely framed in Wisconsin and has played an integral role in the campaign in a state that has been described by John Johnson, a researcher at Marquette University Law School, as “not one moderate state,” but “one very conservative state overlapping another very liberal one.”\\n\\nRedistricting has been a concern since the state’s maps were considerably redrawn in 2011 when then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was in office. Those maps, which Democrats at the time contended favored the GOP, were litigated in state and federal courts and eventually at the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to rule on the constitutionality of the maps and sent it back to a district court.\\n\\nThe 2011 maps stayed in place, and Mr. Evers made redistricting an issue in his 2018 campaign for governor. He attempted to put the nonpartisan People’s Maps Commission in charge of redistricting to take the process out of the hands of the Wisconsin Legislature.\\n\\n“All the statewide officials elected are Democrats,” which shows Democrats fare well in elections, Mr. Evers said in late October. But about two-thirds of the members of the state Legislature are Republican—which he described as “clearly gerrymandering.”\\n\\nThe protracted battle over redistricting ended earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the map Mr. Evers had backed. The issue was then taken up again by the state Supreme Court, which in April selected the map proposed by Republicans.\\n\\nMr. Evers has said he would continue to fight against gerrymandering and warned at a recent rally in Racine that the state wouldn’t be the same if Mr. Michels were elected.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the current campaign represents Mr. Michels’s first major foray into politics, and he has made his outsider status a top feature of his campaign. His family’s construction company, Michels Corp., has received more than $1.1 billion from Wisconsin since 2014 for construction projects, according to state records. He has said he would divest himself but has provided few details.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Michels, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has pledged tax cuts and hammered the issue of crime.\\n\\nWisconsin has seen an increase in violent crime in recent years, according to FBI statistics, in line with national trends. Mr. Michels has repeatedly called Mr. Evers weak on crime. In October, he tweeted out a video of himself by a car with a shattered window and wrote: “Someone broke into a Kia and tried to steal it right in front of our press conference in Milwaukee. This is what happens when criminals feel emboldened by weak leadership.”\\n\\nMr. Michels also has criticized Mr. Evers’s handling of the violence that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., in 2020. A Michels campaign ad said the governor “fanned the flames” during the ensuing unrest. Mr. Evers has responded that he called in the National Guard to quell violence, and pointed to increases in funding for public safety.\\n\\nMr. Michels and his campaign didn’t respond to more than a dozen requests for comment for this article.\\n\\nIn recent days, the GOP challenger’s campaign has sparred with reporters, and called the police on several journalists when they tried to cover a publicly advertised event.\\n\\nMr. Evers says he has been a steady hand in his first term as governor and emphasized increased spending on education and infrastructure.\\n\\n“We fixed the damn roads,” Mr. Evers said at the rally in Racine, where he ticked off other accomplishments as supporters sampled a buffet of kringles, the state’s official pastry.\\n\\nMr. Evers, along with Democrats nationwide, has also made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign. Mr. Michels has embraced a strict antiabortion law from 1849 that has no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was an “exact mirror” of his own position on abortion, though his campaign subsequently walked back some statements.\\n\\nMore recently, he said he wouldn’t fully enforce the law.\\n\\n“I will never arrest a doctor, as they’re saying. I’m a reasonable guy,” Mr. Michels said in October. “I will not be an authoritarian governor.”\\n\\nWrite to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com', 'summary': '', 'authors': [], 'keywords': []}, {'_id': 7, 'title': 'Vladimir Putin close to losing port city Kherson as Ukraine fights back', 'body': \"© Provided by Metro Moscow has been ferrying people out of Kherson under the backing of President Putin, above (Picture: Shutterstock)\\n\\nVladimir Putin has publicly backed evacuating civilians amid hopes that his forces will soon be forced to retreat from Ukrainian port city Kherson.\\n\\nAs Ukraine’s troops steadily regain territory on the outskirts, the Russian president said: ‘Those who live in Kherson should be removed from the zone of the most dangerous actions, because the civilian population should not suffer.’\\n\\nThe remarks to pro-Kremlin activists came as he marked Russia’s Day of National Unity.\\n\\nMoscow has been ferrying people out of the area on the west bank of the Dnipro river and last week expanded the evacuation zone to include a nine-mile buffer area on the east bank.\\n\\nKyiv says the process has included forced deportations of civilians, which is a war crime.\\n\\nA 24-hour curfew was imposed on Kherson on Friday, while pictures online show the Russian flag no long flies on its main administration building.\\n\\n© Provided by Metro Ukraine fears their troops could be lured into a trap by Russia (Picture: AP)\\n\\nKyiv has been wary, saying such signs could be Russian deception to lure Ukrainian troops into a trap.\\n\\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in Kherson, said he hoped there would be no retreat but ‘we have to take some very difficult decisions’.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Volodymyr Zelensky said the fiercest fighting last week was around Bakhmut and Soledar, in the eastern Donetsk region about 310 miles north-east of Kherson.\\n\\n‘We are holding our positions,’ the Ukrainian president added.\\n\\nHe accused Russia of stubbornness for sending ‘tens or hundreds of thousands more people to the meat grinder’.\\n\\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\\n\\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\\n\\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more by signing up to Metro's News Updates newsletter\", 'summary': '', 'authors': [], 'keywords': []}, {'_id': 8, 'title': 'The shocking death of Aaron Carter, 34', 'body': 'You are using an older browser version.

The answer can be confusing, because it varies based on driving conditions and your driving habits. Let us simplify it for you.\\n\\nConservative estimates for oil-change intervals used to be as low as 3000 miles, before significant improvements in fuel-delivery systems, engine materials, manufacturing methods, and oil chemistry. Today, modern engines driven normally stretch intervals to 7500 or even more than 10,000 miles. So what's the right answer?\\n\\nWhen Your Vehicle Is in Warranty\\n\\nWhen a vehicle is new, the answer is simple: If you don't want to void your powertrain warranty, follow the oil type, mileage, and time recommendations in the owner's manual. (Lost your owner's manual? It's likely available online.) In most cases, you'll be taking your vehicle to the dealer for required inspections and maintenance, and oil changes will be included in that regime.\\n\\n© Getty Images Close Up of Digital Oil Gauge\\n\\nSome newer vehicles have a built-in oil-life monitor. This gadget uses an algorithm, sensors, and software that keep track of drive temperatures, cold starts, driving hours, idling hours, and engine revs. It uses that data to calculate the oil's condition and warranty-preserving change intervals. Keep in mind that the oil monitor is calibrated for the oil type recommended in the owner's manual. Service alerts are displayed in the instrument cluster. In some systems, one of the instrument-cluster information screens will read out remaining oil life as a percentage. This is much different from the red oil-pressure warning light that glows when you start the engine. If that's on while you're driving or idling, it means you're out of oil or have a very serious engine issue. Time to park and key off.\\n\\nWhen Your Vehicle Is Out of Warranty\\n\\nOnce you're outside the maker's warranty, determining change intervals requires some common sense and an educated guess—unless your vehicle has an aforementioned oil-life monitor. There are often different recommendations for normal and severe driving. Intervals vary widely depending on whom you ask, whether you tow (and how often), the time of year, and even where you drive.\\n\\nSevere conditions include:\\n\\nIf you make many short trips of five miles or less (in normal temperatures)\\n\\nIf you make many short trips of 10 miles or less (in freezing temperatures)\\n\\nExtreme hot-weather stop-and-go driving\\n\\nDriving at low speeds for long distances\\n\\nLots of miles on dusty, muddy, salty, sandy, or gravel roads\\n\\nLong-distance trailer towing\\n\\nTrack driving\\n\\n© Getty Images Oil Cap\\n\\nAre Frequent Oil Changes Better?\\n\\nNot surprisingly, service providers (oil-change shops and dealerships) tend to recommend shorter change intervals (3000 to 5000 miles). That can never hurt your engine, but it also means they'll see you and your credit card more often. When your car's on the lift for an oil change, other wear items such as brake pads, coolant, tires, and shocks can also be assessed and possibly replaced. So it's also obviously good for their business. (With older vehicles, which may burn oil, you'll want to check the oil level using the dipstick at least once a month.) But if you're not driving your car in severe conditions—and few of us are—you can stick to the manufacturer's recommended oil-change intervals (which often include an oil-filter change at the same time). And, of course, if your car has an oil-life monitor, heed that.\\n\\nLonger-Life Oils\\n\\nWhat about using premium extended-life and pricey synthetic oils for projected 10,000- and even 12,000-mile changes? About synthetics: Almost all newer vehicles use synthetic oil, so if the manufacturer specifies that, you must use it. Many older vehicles weren't filled with synthetics when new and still use conventional petroleum-based oil. In that case, you have a choice.\\n\\nSome oil refiners produce sophisticated carmaker-approved extended-life oils that do help stretch the time between changes. These oils have special chemistry or additives that support their ability to go longer distances. They resist high-temperature breakdown better and keep dirt and particulates in suspension longer so that the oil filter can catch them. They also cost more than standard oils; you'll need to do the math to see if it's worth the extra cost.\\n\\n© Getty Images Refilling Oil\\n\\nA Few Words of Caution\\n\\nIf you operate on dirt roads or in dusty or road-salted environments and do lots of cold starts and short runs, the factory oil filter has only so much scrubbing capacity. (That's why most makers recommend replacing the filter at each oil change.) Further, the longer-range oils can become contaminated by the sheer volume of combustion gases that blow past the worn piston rings of older cars. At some point, the oil is no longer protecting the sliding surfaces within the engine as well as it should. Engine wear accelerates after the oil breaks down or is highly contaminated. And finally, almost no automaker recommends that oil should be left in the crankcase for more than one year—no matter the mileage.\\n\\nRecycling Oil\\n\\nIf you're changing your own oil, be sure to recycle properly. Most auto-parts stores (check before you buy) and oil-change businesses will take back used oil at no charge. Whether you do it yourself or have it done for you, changing your oil at the proper intervals will make your engine last longer and run better.\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\nHow often should you change your oil in months?\\n\\nIt depends on the manufacturer. The old-school way was every three months, but with improvements to oil quality and engine materials, that interval can be pushed to anywhere between six and 12 months. Your owner's manual will detail the interval.\\n\\nWhat happens if you go too long without an oil change?\\n\\nAs your oil quality wears down, so do the components it's supposed to protect. If you go excessively long between oil changes, you'll reach the point of no return, and your vehicle's engine will become a massive repair bill, or even total failure.\\n\\nCan I change oil every two years?\\n\\nNo. Almost no automaker recommends that oil should be left in the crankcase for more than one year—no matter the mileage.\\n\\nHow do I know when my oil needs changing?\\n\\nTypically, follow the mileage and time intervals listed by your vehicle's manufacturer. But this can vary, depending on the severity of your driving. As detailed above, shorter trips, track time, and dusty roads can cause your oil to break down faster and need to be changed earlier.\\n\\nSome vehicles have instrument-cluster information screens that will read out remaining oil life as a percentage. If you don't have this feature, follow along with the sticker from the oil-change place or keep track of mileage on your own.

For decades, crash test dummies were based on the average male body size, leaving the average woman less protected in crashes. We\\'ve known about this since at least 2013 when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published a safety report that found that women were more likely to be killed or injured in a crash and were especially \"susceptible to neck and abdominal injuries.\" The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) published a report with similar findings in 2019.\\n\\nAutomotive safety engineers have worked on solutions for the past decade, too. In 2012, researchers published a paper on neck injuries in crash tests using \"a new female dummy prototype.\" Work continued on crash dummies that better represented female bodies. European researchers, for example, explored how better-designed dummies could help with whiplash injuries (2017) and quickly moved on to a broader discussion of how more representative \"occupant models\" would help more people in society (2019).\\n\\nOne of the researchers whose name was on all of those papers is Astrid Linder, director of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (known as VTI). Linder recently told the BBC about the work she and her team have done to develop a dummy that accurately mimics the average female body. This is not the first female-based dummy. IIHS has been using female crash test dummies since 2003, for example, and some crash test sites use scaled-down male dummies that represented women inaccurately. Linder said the one VTI developed is more than just a better size at five feet, three inches tall and weighing 97 pounds; the way it moves better represents how female bodies move in a crash, given their different muscle strengths.\\n\\n\"We have differences in the shape of the torso and the center of gravity and the outline of our hips and pelvis,\" Linder told the BBC.\\n\\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad\\n\\nJust because we now have a better way to test the impact of crashes on both male and female bodies does not mean that vehicle safety features will change tomorrow. No laws anywhere require crash tests to use male and female dummies, and engineers can\\'t fix problems they can\\'t identify. Some automakers are already using gendered dummies in their crash tests, but Linder said she hopes their use becomes much more widespread.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see headline CPI at an annual 7.9% for the month, a moderation from September’s year-over-year increase of 8.2%. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy components of the measure, is projected to come in at 6.5%, little changed from 6.6% last month.\n",

       " 'title': '8 things to know about Elon Musk and Twitter: Morning Brief',\n",
       " 'body': 'LISBON, Portugal — It only took about ten minutes to get to Elon.\\n\\nI’m at a press conference with Microsoft President Brad Smith and Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday.\\n\\nSmith announced a donation of $100 million of cloud services to help Ukraine fight the Russians. Second question in the Q&A: “Is Elon Musk still supporting Ukraine through Starlink [his satellite internet service]?\\n\\nFedorov smiles and says something in Ukrainian. Translation: “Yes, Elon is.”\\n\\nMusk seems to be part of every conversation these days. Here at the world\\'s largest tech conference — 71,033 attendees from 160 countries — Musk is an overwhelming presence, even though he’s not physically present. If it’s not SpaceX and Starlink, it’s Tesla and of course Twitter. What is Musk doing? What is he thinking? What’s up with the layoffs?\\n\\nThis is the case even in Europe, where distrust and antipathy towards big American tech companies runs high. Web Summit is made up of many more Europeans than say CES or South by Southwest: Americans are only the fifth biggest contingent here, according to Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave. That makes it a great place to get a different perspective on Musk — though Elon’s taking all the air out of the room here, too.\\n\\nThis video grab taken from a video posted on the Twitter account of billionaire Tesla chief Elon Musk on October 26, 2022 shows himself carrying a sink as he enters the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. (Photo by various sources / AFP)\\n\\nElon is seemingly bound and determined to dominate the news cycle. Every. Single. Day. You can call him a relentless self-promoter, insanely narcissistic, or just off his rocker. But he’s also trying to foist massive change on massive industries; cars, space travel, social media, really humanity, in real time. You may hate him, you may love him, but as the line goes, one thing you can’t do is ignore him.\\n\\nMusk is the richest man in the world and one of the most famous people in the world who’s constantly seeking attention on one of the world’s biggest social media platforms, which he now owns. That’s a pretty powerful combination.\\n\\nSo getting back to Twitter, the hottest sector of Musk’s heat map right now, what exactly do we know — besides his sometimes amusing, sometimes trolly posts and squabbles with AOC?\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFirst, as Microsoft’s Brad Smith told me: “Elon Musk is undeniably one of the greatest technology visionaries of our generation.” Second: Running a social media company — and turning it into a super app — may or may not be outside Elon’s area of expertise. Third: Twitter now has $13 billion of debt on its books, making it highly leveraged, which will certainly affect Musk’s decisionmaking. Fourth: Even though Twitter has 238 million DAUs, Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley points out it is getting long in the tooth as upstarts like TikTok, BeReal and Discord take market share and attract younger audiences. Fifth: We don’t know the degree to which Musk has an actual plan. Sixth: No doubt Twitter detracts from Musk running SpaceX and Tesla etc. Seventh: Many have doubted him before, and he has delivered. Sometimes. Which really has no bearing on Twitter.\\n\\nAmbiguous enough for you? Sorry not to be more definitive, but that’s all the gospel.\\n\\n“I am a technical person — I do coding — so I have a lot of respect for Elon as a technical person,\" Mikki Kobvel, a Ukrainian software consultant based in Lisbon and Singapore, told me. \"But I get worried when I see someone doing something just for their reputation for their image.\"\\n\\nAn antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by the US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on September 25, 2022. (Photo by Yasuyoshi CHIBA / AFP)\\n\\nAndrey Khusid, founder and CEO of Miro, a unicorn tech company based in the Netherlands with offices in San Francisco, said that \"Elon is obviously a genius with all his companies. I think it is 50/50 whether Elon will succeed with Twitter, but I do think he has a plan. Right now these are just steps. I think he has a big picture idea and I think we need to judge him on the outcome not just the steps along the way. Maybe it will be the most important social media platform in the world.”\\n\\nAmericans here are sharing their take on Musk too, most notably ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood.\\n\\n“We did invest [in Twitter], as [Elon] took it private. We\\'re very excited about that,” Wood told interviewer Ann Curry on the main stage. “Elon believes in vertical integration. I think he could turn this into a super app like WeChat pay. Remember, he started in the payments industry with PayPal.”\\n\\nWood has actually created a way for retail investors to buy into Twitter through the Ark Venture Fund, which reportedly has 12% of its assets in Twitter. Investors can buy into with as little as $500.\\n\\nCurry also asked Wood about Twitter’s toxicity.\\n\\n“The darkness was in their opacity,” Wood said. “We didn\\'t see the algorithms and how they were working.”\\n\\nWood added that she believes Twitter could rely on open-source code and software which could be viewed and modified by the public.\\n\\nCathie Wood, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer at ARK Invest, speaks during a session at the Web Summit in Lisbon on November 2, 2022. (Photo by Henrique Casinhas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nThis is a perspective shared by Chris Anderson, head of TED (as in TED Talks), who spoke with me at a dinner about how he believes Musk will move toward some sort of crowdsourced and or outsourced model to determine what content is accentuated.\\n\\nYou may remember that Anderson, who wrote a prescient 2013 Businessperson of the Year cover story on Musk for Fortune when I was the editor there, interviewed Musk in April when he first made a bid for Twitter, and Musk spoke about open source then.\\n\\nIn the interview, Musk said that “one of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people\\'s tweets, if they\\'re emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should be made apparent so anyone can see that action\\'s been taken so there\\'s no behind the scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually.\" (The full hour plus interview is here. Transcript here.)\\n\\nAt another dinner I caught up with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ), very much a star here, who now lives part-time in Paris (\"It\\'s quite crypto friendly,\" he told me.) CZ just made news for... you guessed it... investing $500 million in Elon\\'s Twitter buyout. Why?\\n\\n\"It\\'s all about freedom of speech,\" he said.\\n\\nBeyond the super app and open sourcing, there are all manner of rabbit holes and conspiracy theories out there on what Musk intends to do with Twitter. Or, as one Web Summit participant from Britain said to me regarding Elon’s Twitter: “The content moderation will become the product.”\\n\\nI think I know what that means, but I’m not sure.\\n\\nBesides his laudatory point about Musk, Microsoft’s Smith sought to make a distinction between Twitter and his company’s social media platform.\\n\\n“At LinkedIn [which Microsoft owns], we really strive to use it as a platform that creates more light than heat,\" he said. \"In the world today, there\\'s a lot of heat, and I think we should all strive to ensure there\\'s a little more light, and let\\'s see if we can advance civil discourse along the way.”\\n\\nAnd that would be the eighth thing we know about Elon and Twitter: Advancing civil discourse is probably not so high on his agenda.\\n\\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\\n\\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\\n\\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube'}"
